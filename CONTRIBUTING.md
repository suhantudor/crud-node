### Working on crud-node

#### Prerequisites

- Git
- Latest version of Node.js

#### Getting crud-node

Fork a copy of our repo
Open up Git in an environment of your choice

```ts
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-PROFILE-NAME/crud-node.git
$ cd crud-node
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

#### Using branches

When working on any issue on Github, it's a good practice to make branches that are specific to the issue you're currently working on. For instance, if you're working on an issue with a name like "NAME OF ISSUE #1234", from the main branch run the following code: git checkout -b Issue#1234. In doing so, you'll be making a branch that specifically identifies the issue at hand, and moves you right into it with the checkout flag. This keeps your main repository clean and your personal workflow cruft out of sight when making a pull request.

#### Finding issues to fix

After you've forked and cloned our repo, you can find issues to work on by heading over to our issues list. We advise looking at the issues with the labels help wanted or good first issue, as they will help you get familiar with the crud-node code.

#### Rules of the discussions

Remember to be very clear and transparent when discussing any issue in the discussions boards. We ask that you keep the language to English and keep on track with the issue at hand. Lastly, please be respectful of our fellow contributors and keep an exemplary level of professionalism at all times.
