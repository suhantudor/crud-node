# ðŸ§° API Schema (soon)

We use \`[https://json-schema.org/](https://json-schema.org/)\` to ensure implementation consistency across all adapters. Even if we speak about MySQL, MySQLX, Cassandra, Postgres, Mongo, etc, the package should preserve the same interface on all adapters to be easy to use and switch between databases.
